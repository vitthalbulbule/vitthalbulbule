## 👨‍💻 About Me
Passionate about technology and business 

👋 Hi! I'm Vitthal, a data analyst with experience in turning complex data into useful information to help businesses make better decisions and improve operational efficiency.

I’m a curious person, always looking to understand the "why" behind things. My thinking is analytical and detail-oriented, which allows me to approach problems from different perspectives. I’m enthusiastic and always eager to learn, which helps me constantly improve in everything I do.

I strongly believe in continuous learning, which is why I’m currently expanding my knowledge in Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. This approach allows me to deepen my understanding of the entire data lifecycle, from storage to analysis and generating insights that help businesses make data-driven strategic decisions.

I’m looking to join a dynamic team where I can continue learning, growing professionally, and contribute with my curiosity and dedication. If you’re looking for someone with an analytical approach, motivated by learning, and committed to adding value through data, I’d be happy to connect.
